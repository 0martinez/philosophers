ACTUAL STATE OF THE PROJECT:

-act of the struct philo and philo terms


-add a philo init
-added a file called "philo_dance", where im going to start all
 the philo proces(dance)
-the actua state of the "philo_dance";
    i can create a thread and call a function called (philo_moves).
    in that function imm going to call all the main moves of
    the philos(eat, sleep and think).
-funny facts:
    -just discovered that the OS do my work with leaks if i
     call an exit()
    -ive done a extreme cast, "(void *)&philo[i]". i fell like a god
     of pointers right now hahaha, im so funny i know -_-
