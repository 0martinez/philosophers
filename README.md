ACTUAL STATE OF THE PROJECT:


-moves of the philo done, i still have to do some changes of the moves to complement it
    in a better way with the main program



-ive done a function where i emulate the dancing of the philo



-im having problems with the mutex, they dont stop the thread when is needed(working on it...)
    but if i use global mutex it works correctly, but anyways the programs stop working
    and dont now why xddd, the oscar of the future will work on that...



-ive colored the printfs to identify in a better way in what state iss the philo in what moment



-act of the philo struct, you can identify a philo term struct inside of it
